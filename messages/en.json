Walking along the shore is pure delight, with the crisp breeze filling your lungs and the sight of pristine white yachts captivating your gaze. Itâ€™s equally enchanting to wander aimlessly through the city streets, admiring the ancient stonework of the buildings and the vibrant splashes of ripe lemons and mandarins.",
