Walking along the shore is pure delight, with the crisp breeze filling your lungs and the sight of pristine white yachts captivating your gaze. It’s equally enchanting to wander aimlessly through the city streets, admiring the ancient stonework of the buildings and the vibrant splashes of ripe lemons and mandarins.",

Walking along the sea never gets old; the water in the Adriatic is an amazing color. Every day brings a new view. Today, the water is mirror-like, and a diver with an orange signal buoy is gathering sea delicacies; tomorrow, waves after a storm are splashing over the pedestrian paths while seabirds search for food.</p>",

Along the promenade, there are numerous cafes and restaurants where you can try local cuisine, have some sushi rolls, or grab a slice of pizza to take with you on your walk.</p>",

Everything is also very specialized: bread and pastries are sold in bakeries, meat in butcher shops, and fruits in fruit stores.</p>"
